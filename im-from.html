I’m from lifted trucks
I'm from lowered expectations
I’m from dusty trails
I'm from unsullied congregations

I’m from lakes I can’t swim in
I’m from forbidden summits
I’m from gated streams and polluted rivers
I’m from excess and I’m from nothing

I’m from cloudless skies 
I’m from powdered water
I’m from illegalize the homeless
I’m from too busy to be bothered

I’m from day worker hands
I’m from manicured nails
I’m from no habla ingles
I’m from don’t ask, don’t tell

I’m from botoxic injections
I’m from the quest of perfection
I’m from conspiracy theories and the fear of rejection

I’m from no mayor, no city council
I’m from no wind in the sails
I’m from the depths of the sea where I rest my head on the bones dead whales

I’m from the box
I’m from the table
I’m from a grove with no trees
I'm from a house of fools gold, the jewel always just out of reach
I’m from a bridge to an island with soldiers on the beach
I’m from those secrets you keep hidden under your sheets

I’m from tribe lands invaded by amputee bandits
I’m from a wall, I’m from barbed wire, I’m from a line in the sand
I’m from anti-immigrant immigrants shouting This Is Our Land

I’m from one season
I’m from even fewer points of view
I’m from school shootings but you probably are too

I’m from taco shops next door to taco shops
I’m from a desert of lost seagulls
I’m from fries in the burrito
I’m from desperate but equal

I’m from desert rats eaten by mountain cats
I’m from sticks and stones and I’m from the father’s bat

I’m from americas finest
I’m from the world famous
I’m from a black fish and a white bear–but doesn’t mean you can tame us

I’m from the southern terminus
I’m from trails with no truth
I’m from that thought you can never escape–run away and you’ll run through

I’m from darkness, I’m from madness
I’m from passion, I’m from heart
I’m from an angel, I’m from a demon–can’t separate the parts

I’m from little leagues and childhood dreams
I’m from the tired and beleaguered crawling on concrete streams
I’m from the shadows in the dark that we can never see
I’m from the haunted of the haunted
I’m from a hive with no honey, just the stinger of the bee

I’m from war culture
I’m from rape culture
I’m from no culture at all 
I’m from overtime parents, backs against the wall

I’m from a skyline of intolerance
I’m from an expensive smile in a cheap suit
I’m from the ground zero of an unfortunate youth
Once wild at heart, now rotting fruit
